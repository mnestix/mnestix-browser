## Folder Structure

### Naming Conventions:

Naming convention for components and component files: Camel Case (e.g. FileName.tsx)  
Naming convention for folders: Kebab Case (e.g. folder-name)

### Folder Structure:

In general, we want to group code by pages and features, not by file type.
Each route segment has a `/components` folder which contains all elements which are solely used in this route.  
Files that are shared between route segments, are located in the following shared folders:

-   `\layout`: Overall application appearance including theming, menu etc.
-   `\lib`: Shared logic and types as well as interfaces to external apis.
-   `\components`: All components which can be shared between several routes.
-   `\assets`: Static assets such as images, icons oder other similar files.
