### Welcome to the Mnestix Community!

Mnestix Browser is an open source software designed to simplify the implementation of the Asset Administration Shell.
Together
with increasing contributions from users and developers, a growing community is working on further development under the
leadership of XITASO, a leading high-end software development company in the engineering industry.
Mnestix Browser is the perfect tool to demonstrate the power and potential of AAS (**Asset Administration Shells**) for
the
implementation of standardized digital twins. It opens the way for use cases such as the Digital Product Passport (DPP).

You can find a demo [here](https://mnestix-prod.azurewebsites.net/).
Some screenshots can be found in the [screenshots folder](screenshots).
